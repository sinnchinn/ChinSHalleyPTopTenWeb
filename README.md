  - Worked and styled the home page on Thursday, Oct 26. Added a Carousel and Nav Bar with a drop down. Pages are very similar with accordions. Had a issue with sizing to a tablet. Because my figma of the tablet version looked different than how it originally looks, some rows appeared at the top when I wanted them at the bottom. Looked at docs, found display property. Did use col-lg-12 and such but also used (.d-md-none .d-lg-block) so that I hide the container and then copy and pasted the certain container. To make it visible (.d-none .d-md-block .d-lg-none). Also had an problem with my image moving alongside my accordions. Realized that I had a class with the display flex and align-items-center that was causing the issue.
